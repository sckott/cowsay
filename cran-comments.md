I have read and agree to the the CRAN policies at 
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.2.2 and
R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Windows
R 3.2.2 and devel on Win-Builder.

This is a new submission.

Thanks! 
Scott Chamberlain
