### What is this?

If you are familiar with `cowsay` on the cli, then you know what this is, but for R.  If not, read below.  Why?  Why not?

### Contributors (alphabetical)

```{r echo=FALSE}
peeps <- c(
  "Scott Chamberlain",
  "Tyler Rinker",
  "Thomas Leeper",
  "Noam Ross",
  "Rich FitzJohn",
  "Kiyoko Gotanda",

  "Amanda Dobbyn",
  "Marion Louveaux",
  "David Schoch"
)
```

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat(c("", sort(peeps)), sep = "\n * ")
```

That's right, it takes `r length(peeps)` people to make `cowsay` - it's that hard.

### Where to find ASCII animal art

Sources to look in:

* https://asciiart.website/ - again, this person only collects them - no mention of license, permissions, etc.

Permissions

In the ascii art mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/alt.ascii-art they say:

```
 As for posting other people's ASCII art,
    after a discussion in news:alt.ascii-art       _     ___
    the following rules were agreed upon:         #_~`--'__ `===-,
    1.  If an ASCII ART picture has initials      `.`.     `#.,//
        on it, leave them on when posting it      ,_\_\     ## #\
    2.  If an ASCII ART picture doesn't have      `__.__    `####\
        initials on it,  mention  that  you            ~~\ ,###'~
        didn't  draw  it  when  posting  it.              \##'
    3.  If somebody  posts a picture without                  [nosig]
        initials and you have an original copy
        with initials on, feel free to re-post the original version.
        *   The re-post ought not to be taken personally, as we all
            know that ASCII art often loses proper credits.
            Responses to the re-post are not necessary.

    One contributor, name of Krogg, suggested the following:

    1.) Ultra polite:...ya make yer own ascii and use it.
    2.)  Very polite:...Ya contact the author and ask if ya
                        can use it...
    3.)       polite:...Ya use it but you keep the Credits
                        in there like they should be.
    4.)         rude:...Ya use it and strip credits.
    5.)    Very rude:...Ya use it and claim that it Is
                        _Your_ very own creation...
```

So, let's go with this rule: Let's include found (on the web) ascii art in this pkg, include signature if there, and if no signature, put in a `[nosig]` (see above).

### Quick watch start

Asciicast: <https://asciinema.org/a/7745>

### Install

From CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("cowsay")
```

Dev version

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("sckott/cowsay")
```

```{r}
library("cowsay")
```

### The animals

```{r}
sort(names(animals))
```

### Say Something

```{r}
say('time')
```

```{r}
say("ain't that some shit", "chicken")
```

Add some color: 

```{r}
library(crayon)
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
say("boo!", "ghost", 
    what_color = "cyan", by_color = "saddlebrown")
```


<p align="left">
  <img src="./man/img/ghost.jpg" alt="ghost" height="200px">
</p>


```{r eval=FALSE}
say("I love hooo you are!", "owl", 
    what_color = rgb(0, 1, 1), by_color = "#FF0000")
```


<p align="left">
  <img src="./man/img/owl.jpg" alt="owl" height="200px">
</p>


String styles together [crayon-style](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon#styles):


```{r eval=FALSE}
say(what = "rms", by = "rms", 
        what_color = yellow$bgMagenta$bold,
        by_color = cyan$italic)
```


<p align="left">
  <img src="./man/img/rms.jpg" alt="rms" height="350px">
</p>


This doesn't preclude you from adding extra crayon colors to your `what` string directly.


```{r eval=FALSE}
say(what = paste0("hello ", crayon::yellow("there "), crayon::underline("world")), 
    by = "trilobite", 
    what_color = bgBlue$cyan$italic,
    by_color = "thistle")  # Don't ask me why "thistle" is pink/purple
```


<p align="left">
  <img src="./man/img/trilobite.jpg" alt="trilobite" height="250px">
</p>


<!-- Multiple colors are also possible (uses the [`multicolor`](https://github.com/aedobbyn/multicolor) package):


```{r eval=FALSE}
say(what = "I'm a rare Irish buffalo",
    by = "buffalo", 
    what_color = c("salmon2", "darkcyan", "salmon2", "darkcyan"),
    by_color = c("green", "white", "orange"))
```


<p align="left">
  <img src="./man/img/irish_buffalo.jpg" alt="irish_buffalo" height="350px">
</p>
 -->

### Vary type of output, default calls message()

```{r}
say("hell no!")
```


```{r}
say("hell no!", type="warning")
```


```{r}
say("hell no!", type="string")
```


### Catfacts!!!!

From the catfacts API  at <https://catfact.ninja>

```{r eval=FALSE}
say("catfact", "cat")
#> --------------
#> When a domestic cat goes after mice, about 1 pounce in 3 results in a catch.
#> --------------
#>    \
#>      \
#>        \
#>            |\___/|
#>          ==) ^Y^ (==
#>            \  ^  /
#>             )=*=(
#>            /     \
#>            |     |
#>           /| | | |\
#>           \| | |_|/\
#>      jgs  //_// ___/
#>               \_)
```

### Long cat

From the a Boing Boing tweet on 2014-05-10 "twitter.com/BoingBoing/status/465170473194512384" (post may be gone)

```{r}
say("it's caturday", "longcat")

say('NO!', by='grumpycat')

```

### Fish

say(fortune=100)
```

```{r}
say(fortune='whatever')

```

### Using pipes

```{r}
library("magrittr")
"I HAD FUN ONCE, IT WAS AWFUL" %>% say('grumpycat')
```

### I just want the animals!

Okay, hold your endless horses. Just use the exported vector `animals`, and you can select the animal you want by name.

```{r}
animals['clippy']
```
